# WalletConnect Example Dapp

This is an example of a WalletConnect Dapp on Algorand. Paired with a wallet that supports WalletConnect on Algorand, such as [Pera Wallet](https://perawallet.app/), it can be used to demonstrate how WalletConnect works and to test signing different transactions with a wallet.

This demo adheres to [ARC-25](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/ARCs/blob/main/ARCs/arc-0025.md), which contains the specification for WalletConnect on Algorand.

The latest version of this demo is live at https://jasonpaulos.github.io/algorand-walletconnect-example-dapp/.
